# Breast Cancer SVM Demo

For this project I used a breast cancer data set. It consists of many features describing a tumor and classifies them as either cancerous or non cancerous.

Similar to K Nearest Neighbors, SVMs are commonly used for classification tasks.
They're great for high-dimensional data, and they let us classify data that doesn't have a linear relationship.

Dependency:

pip install python

pip install sklearn
